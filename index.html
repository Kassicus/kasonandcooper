                    <p class="story-text font-regular">Kason and Cooper met in a bit of an odd manner. On April 29th 2022 Cooper had invited her longtime friend (and Maid of Honor) Erin Steere to attend her brothers highschool jazz band concert. In turn, Erin invited her friend Eric who happened to be roommates with Kason. Kason, with nothing going on that evening, asked Eric where he was off to in such a hurry. When the response was "some sort of Jazz concert" Kason asked if he could tag along as it sounded interesting. Later that evening, after a very cold outdoor Jazz band concert the four decided to go grab dinner together at McDonalds before going hatchet throwing. It was around this point that Kason and Cooper hit it off.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="story-text font-regular">Shortly after that night Erin moved in with Kason and Eric in a new aparment about 20 minutes from where Cooper was living. Cooper began spending a lot of time around that apartment and the relationship between her and Kason slowly started to grow.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="story-text font-regular">The two became friends almost immediately and started growing closer very quickly. By mid June of 2022 the pair decided to go on their first date, a very competitve game of mini golf in a light rainstorm. Soon after they decided to start dating. They continued on this path very casually at first and eventually got serious on December 9th 2022.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="story-text font-regular">In May of 2023 the pair decided they were going to move in together. They wanted to live together before comitting to taking the relationship further. They both found this to be a massively positive move in their lives and it only cemented their goals for the future.</p>
                    <span class="todo">{TODO: Coop, how much of the span from May to December do you want to touch on?}</span>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="story-text font-regular">By mid October they started having conversations about getting married. Initially they were considering fall of 2025 when having these conversations as they thought that fall of 2024 was going to approach too fast. They seemingly forgot that they lived in Utah which maybe the most specialized state in turning around quick weddings. With that realization they started thinking about fall 2024.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p class="story-text font-regular">Kason made it very clear to Cooper that with the holidays and christmas coming up there was no way they would be getting engaged until spring of 2024. He continued to mention this until November when the couple met up with some friends at an event Cooper had been talking about wanting to do ever since she met Kason. He proposed that night and (of course) she said yes. She also immediately called him a bastard ~love you coop ;)</p>
